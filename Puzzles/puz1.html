<P>The puzzles below vary in difficulty, generally later ones
are harder. 
Almost all of them I have heard from other people. They are purely for amusement. I do not give out answers. I am
always on the lookout for new puzzles. They should be unusual. Most
routine puzzles are of no interest to me.
<P>

<LI><FONT SIZE=-1><B><A HREF="missingsquare.jpeg"> Surely this is impossible!</A></B></FONT></LI>
</UL>
<P>[1]  An ant starts at one end of a rubber band and
walks along it at a speed of 1 inch per second. The rubber band
is 10 inches long, and is being stretched uniformly at a rate
of 20 inches per second. Does the ant ever reach the other end
of the rubber band?. Give reasons.
<P>
<P>[2]  Can you subdivide
a cube into finitely many smaller cubes no two of which have
the same size?
<P>
<P>[3] What is the maximum number of knights
that you can place on a chess board so that no knight threatens
(ie can jump onto) any other knight? Can you show your answer
is the best possible?
<P>
<P>[4] Suppose I take a chess board,
and remove two squares from opposite corners (ie the corners
are on the same DIAGONAL) Is it possible to cover the remaining
squares using dominoes, where each domino covers  two adjacent
squares?
<P>
<P>[5]  There are 12 balls, identical in
appearance. One of the balls is either heavier or lighter than
the others.If I give you a balance and allow you to make 3
weighings, how could you arrange to discover which ball is the
odd one out, and whether it is heavier or lighter than the
others? [using a balance, you can weigh balls on one side
against balls on the other side]
<P>
<P>[6]  (Easier Prisoner
Puzzle)  A prisoner is held in jail.There are two doors in her
prison cell, one leads to freedom, the other leads to death.
There are two prison guards, one of which always answers
questions truthfully, the other one always lies. Sadly the
prisoner does not know which is which. She is allowed to ask
one question of one of the guards, to which the answer must be
YES or NO. What question should she ask in order to
escape?.
<P>
<P>[7]  (Harder Prisoner Puzzle) Same set up as
[6], except that there is only one guard, who sometimes lies,
and other times tells the truth.
<P>
<P>[8]   89 couples live on
a Desert island. On this Island in paradise, the rule is that
if a woman discovers that her husband has been unfaithful to
her, then at noon on the day after she discovers, she shoots
him dead. When a man is unfaithful, gossip spreads until every
woman, except his wife, knows about it. Regretably, humans
being what they are, every man has in fact been unfaithful. But
all is well until one day a priest visits the enchanted Island
for a year. He gets to know the people well. When he leaves,
everyone is assembled to see him depart. He says how much he
has enjoyed his stay, but that it has come to his attention
that someone has been unfaithful. He does not say who, but
hopes it will not happen again. What is the consequence of this
remark if any?.
<P>
<P>[9]  In a TV show, a prize is hidden
behind one of 3 closed doors. The contestant tries to guess
where the prize is. After the contestant chooses a door, the
host of the show (who knows where the prize is) opens one of
the 2 remaining doors, to reveal that the prize is not behind
that door. The host then gives the contestant the opportunity
to change her guess. Should she?
<P>
<P>[10]  I have a bottle of
vinegar and a bottle of oil. Suppose I transfer a spoonfull of
oil to the vinegar bottle, and then partially mix the contents
of the vinegar bottle, before transfering an equal volume from
the vinegar bottle back to the oil bottle. Question:  which is
greater the amount of oil in the vinegar bottle, or the amount
vinegar in the oil bottle?
<P>
<P>[11]  A monk walks up a
mountain on monday. He sets out at dawn, the day is hot, and he
has many short rests on the way up. He arrives at dusk. He
prays all day Tuesday, and on Wednesday, gets up late, and jogs
down the mountain getting to the bottom in the early afternoon.
He follows the same route both days. Is there some place on his
route which he comes to at EXACTLY the same time on both  days?

3 people all of whom know each other or 3 people so that each
of them does not know the other two.
<P>
<P>[15]  A
race track has fuel dumps spaced around it.  If all the fuel
from all the fuel dumps is put into the tank of a racing car,
it has exactly enough fuel to drive once around the track
before running out of fuel. Suppose I give you a map showing
you the location of the fuel dumps and how much fuel is in each
dump. Your job is to try to find a starting position for the
racing car  (at some fuel dump), so that if you start driving
around the track ,always taking the fuel from any dumps which
you pass,  you can drive once around the entire track without
ever running out of fuel.  Question: is this always possible?
<P>
<P>[16] 
You are standing by a bicycle. If you push backwards
horizontally on the pedal when it is at the bottom position
does the bicycle initially move forwards or backwards?
<P>
<P>[17]  A cylinder which is completely full of water, except
for a bubble of air  held at the bottom, is sealed at both
ends.  There is no air gap between the top of the water and the
top of the cylinder. The pressure the water exerts on the top
of the cylinder is zero.  Suppose the bubble is now allowed to
rise to the top of the cylinder.  Does the pressure at the
bottom of the cylinder change?  and if so, then by how much?. 
Assume that water is incompressible, and that the volume of the
cylinder does not change.
<P>
<P>[18]  A gold brick in a row boat
on a lake is thrown overboard. Does the water level in the lake
rise or fall as a result of this?
<P>

<P>[20]  Two people buy identical hot cups of coffee at the 
same time. The woman puts milk in her coffee immediately, the
man waits 5 minutes and then puts milk in his coffee. The milk
in both cases was the same temperature, and cold. If they both
drink their coffee 6 minutes after buying it, who drinks the
hotter coffee?.
<P>

a scale. If you  put your finger into the water without
touching the sides of the cup, will the scale read a different
weight?

whole numbers which lie in the range between 1 and 200
inclusive.  Show that there is at least one number in the
collection which divides another one in the collection.
<P>
<P>[23]    Suppose you have a piece of wire 12 inches long,
and that you cut it at two points chosen at random so that you
now have 3 pieces of wire of varied lengths. What is the
probability that you can make a triangle from the 3 pieces of
wire without bending any of them?
<P>
<P>[24] A 3x3x3 cube can be cut up into 27 1x1x1

are allowed to move pieces around in between cuts).
<P>
<P>[25]  A mirror reverses left and right but not up and
down. Why?
<P>
<P>[26] There are two bottles each with a
capacity of two liters. One bottle contains one liter of
water, the other contains one liter of wine. There are two
things you can do: (a) pour fluid from either bottle onto
the floor, and (b) pour fluid from one bottle into the
other. The only constraint is that you must always have at

wind at all ?.
<P>
<P>[33]  A finite graph is a finite set of points called
vertices in space together with a finite number of edges
connecting pairs of vertices. Each edge meets exactly 2
vertices, one at each of its endpoints. If one edge meets
another edge they meet only at one endpoint. Prove that if

take: <P> <IMG WIDTH=426 HEIGHT=16 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="displaymath21" SRC="img1.gif"  > <P> if
<I>x</I> is too large then   <IMG WIDTH=16 HEIGHT=14 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline25" SRC="img2.gif"  >   will grow without bound, ie

<P>[36] There are 3 circles in the plane which all
touch each other.  No two circles have the same size. For
each pair of circles draw the two lines which are tangent
to these two circles. These two lines meet at a point
somewhere.  There are 3 such points, 1 pair for each way
of choosing two circles. Prove that the three points lie
in a straight line.
<P>
<P>[37]  Suppose you can manipulate a certain convex
solid   through a circular hole in a wall, is it always
possible to first rotate the object into a suitable
position, and then slide the object through the hole
without having to rotate it any more?.
<P>
<P>[38] A certain right-angled triangle has all its
edges of integer length (eg 3,4,5). You can draw a circle
in the triangle which just touches each of the 3 edges.
Prove that the radius of this circle is an integer.
<P>
<P>[39] I have an old Dodge station wagon. At the front
of the engine compartment there is gap of about 6 inches
called the crumple zone. During a collision, the crumple
zone folds up, absorbing the energy of the impact. It is
designed to absorb the energy from running into a
stationary wall at 10 mph.  Suppose I am driving on the
freeway at 60 mph, and there is a brick wall driving in
front of me at 50 mph in the same direction. I drive into
it at a relative speed of 10 mph, so the crumple zone
should absorb all the energy?. But wait a minute, the
change in my kinetic energy is much greater in this case
(because K.E. <IMG WIDTH=62 HEIGHT=28 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline41" SRC="img7.gif"  >  ). So maybe the crumple zone cant
absorb all that energy?. Which is right?
<P>
<P>[40] Two identical balls roll across the top of a
table on parallel paths. One of the balls has to roll

ball rolls on the flat all the time. Which ball gets to
the far side of the table first, and why?.
<P>
<P>[41] A floor polishing machine has two circular
brushes which rotate in opposite directions when the

machine when it is turned on than when it is off?.(There
is no wax involved.)
<P>
<P>[42] <I>Without calculation</I> decide which is
bigger,   <IMG WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=30 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline43" SRC="img8.gif"  >   or   <IMG WIDTH=31 HEIGHT=30 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline45" SRC="img9.gif"  > 
<P>
<P>[43]  Calculate
<P> <IMG WIDTH=326 HEIGHT=42 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="displaymath47" SRC="img10.gif"  > <P>

largest integer less than or equal to <I>x</I>.
<P>
<P>[44] The game of reverse Tic-Tac-Toe, called

complete circle on the plane around V ?.
<P>
<P>[47] A bicycle leaves tracks on the ground. The
bicycle tires have no tread. Is it possible to decide

claims he could do this in a certain story, which story?)
<P>
<P>[48] What is the largest number of points on a
sphere such that each pair of points can be connected by
a path which does not pass thru any third point nor any
other path?. What about on a torus (= surface of a donut)?
<P>
<P>[49]  If <I>A</I> is an  <IMG WIDTH=38 HEIGHT=14 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline59" SRC="img12.gif"  >  complex matrix, when is there a matrix <I>B</I> such that :  <I>A</I>=<I>B</I>.<I>B</I>,   ie when does <I>A</I> have 
a square root?. If <I>A</I> has a square root, how many does it have?
<P>
<P>[50] There are a countable infinity of spiders on the unit circle. The spiders can move at one inch per 
second, but must always stay on the circle.  A fly can move at 2 inches per second, and starts out 
inside the circle. Can the fly escape from the circle without being eaten by a spider?. The spiders and 
fly are (of course) points.

If you form a new tree  <IMG WIDTH=21 HEIGHT=20 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline101" SRC="img19.gif"  >  by cutting 
off a single edge e from G which is connected to the rest of G only at   <IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=14 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline85" SRC="img16.gif"  >  ie.   <IMG WIDTH=102 HEIGHT=24 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline105" SRC="img20.gif"  >  the hydra grows a 
finite number of new copies of that branch of  <IMG WIDTH=21 HEIGHT=20 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline101" SRC="img19.gif"  >  which starts at   <IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=14 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline97" SRC="img18.gif"  > .

<P>[58] This is about a game called HEX. The plane can be tiled using regular hexagons, so that two hexagons 
either do not meet or else have an edge in common. Suppose that you cut out a roughly parallelogram-
shaped region of the plane made up of some number of these hexagons. The top and bottom sides of this 
parallelogram belong to BLACK, the left and right sides belong to WHITE. Players move alternately, a move 
consists of putting a piece of your color on any unoccupied parallelogram. The winner is the first person to 
connect her two sides by a chain of pieces of her color. Show that a draw is impossible. Show also that if 
pieces are placed on the board until it is full, it is not possible for both players to have connected their 
sides

floor, and (b) pour fluid from one bottle into the other. The only constraint is that you must always have at 
least one liter of fluid in the wine bottle. The object is to dilute the wine in the wine bottle with water as 
much as possible. What is the maximum dilution you can achieve?. Prove it!.
<P>
<P>[62]  Can you find a group G such that G is not isomorphic to the Automorphism group of any other group?.
<P>
<P>[63]  Some crackpot once wrote a book where he claimed that a comet came close to the Earth (but did not 
collide)  and as a result the Earth's rotational axis was switched. In other words the Earth was rotated so 
that the positions of the north and south poles were changed. Is this in fact possible?
<P>
<P>[64]  There are two sealed envelopes containing money. You can choose one of them, open it and see how 
much money is inside. Then you have the choice of taking the money in the envelope you chose or else of 
taking the money in the other envelope without knowing how much is in it. Is there a strategy you can 
follow which will give you better than a 50% chance of choosing the larger amount of money?.  Assume 
that there is a non-zero probability that there is between $<I>n</I> and $(<I>n</I>+1) in either envelope for every 
positive n.

surface is level?.
<P>
<P>[68]  By cutting a square along the 4 line segments joining vertices to midpoints of opposite sides, the 
square is decomposed into 9 pieces which can be re-assembled to form 5 congruent squares. Dissect a 
square into a &quot;small number&quot; of pieces by cutting it along straight lines, so that these pieces can be re-
assembled to form 3 congruent squares. What is the least number of pieces this can be done with?.
<P>
<P>[69] If you have a set A of 101 integers chosen from the numbers  <IMG WIDTH=56 HEIGHT=12 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline117" SRC="img21.gif"  > , show that every integer is the 
sum of 2 numbers from A modulo 200. (you can choose the same number from A twice)
<P>
<P>[70] A lion chases a man inside the unit circle (they are allowed to go onto the circle as well). They both 
move at unit speed. Can the lion catch the man?.
