# Island Puzzles

## Problem 1

There are `N` people on an island, some of which are liars, and others truth-tellers.

It is known that a liar will answer any question randomly (sometimes he/she will lie, sometimes he/she will tell the truth, just to confuse us), and a truth-teller always tells the truth (obviously!).

It is also known that there is at least one truth-teller on the island, and the people know who is a liar and who isn't.

On each day, you can ask each person a question of the form "Is X a liar?". The person will answer correctly if he/she is a truth-teller, and randomly if not.

At the end of each day, you HAVE to ban someone from the island. When you ban someone, you are told if he/she was a truth-teller or not.

Can you ban all of the liars, banning at most one (unlucky) truth-teller on the way?

## Problem 2

There are `99` people on an island, some of which are liars and others truth-tellers.

It is known that a liar will answer any question randomly (sometimes he/she will lie, sometimes he/she will tell the truth, just to confuse us), and a truth-teller always tells the truth.

You also know that there is a strict majority of truth-tellers (at leat `50`) on the island.

Can you tell who is lying and who isn't, by asking at most `299` questions?

The questions you are allowed to ask are "Hey, `X`, is `Y` telling the truth?".
