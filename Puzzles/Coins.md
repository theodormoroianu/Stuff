# Coins Puzzles

## Problem 1

You are given `12` identical coins. On of the coins is fake, and although it looks identical to the other `12`, it has a different weight (either lighter either heavier, we don't know).

You also have a scale with 2 sides, where you can place a subset of the coins on the left side, a (disjoint) subset on the right side, and with one measurement tell if the left side is lighter, equal or heavier than the right side.

What is the minimal amount of measurments required in the wost case for finding which coin is the fake one?

## Problem 2

You are given `N` bags with coins, where the bag #`i` contains identical coins, each weighting exactly `i` grams. You can assume you have a (very) large amount of each type of coins.

You also have a digital scale, on which you can place any amount of coins, and the scale will display its total mass (for instance `1234.567 Kg`). What is the minimal amount of measurements required to find the type of each bag?
